# TODO API

A basic CRUD API using Go for practice. Start the API by running:

```sh
‚ùØ docker-compose up
```

Will fill out the README as I go. For now, everything is in-memory.

## Still to come

* Connect to an actual database
    * PostgreSQL, Couchbase? Something else?
* Clean up and document code
    * Possibly use comments to generate API documentation?
* Tests, tests, tests
* Use Go templates to provide a view of the app which uses the API
